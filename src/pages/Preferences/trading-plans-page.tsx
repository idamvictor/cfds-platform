const FAQS: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "How are VIP account thresholds calculated, is it based on deposit or portfolio value?",
    a: "Account tier eligibility is based on your minimum net deposit into the 1 Trade Market platform. This means the actual fiat or crypto value you deposit, not including unrealized gains. Once you meet the threshold, your tier is activated within 24-48 hours and remains active as long as your balance stays above the minimum requirement. Temporary dips below the threshold (due to market movement) will not immediately trigger a downgrade, our team evaluates this on a monthly basis with a 7-day grace period.",
  },
  {
    q: "When and how can I request physical gold delivery?",
    a: "Physical gold delivery is available quarterly for all accounts from Diamond tier ($500,000) and above. To initiate a delivery request, contact your assigned account manager or submit a request via the dashboard's Premium Benefits section. Deliveries are processed within 10-15 business days and are accompanied by LBMA assay certificates confirming 999.9 fine gold purity. All deliveries are fully insured during transit. As an alternative, clients may opt to store their allocated gold in our secure vault at no additional charge.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I lose my VIP status if my balance drops?",
    a: "Your VIP tier status is protected for a minimum of 30 days after any drop below the tier threshold. This allows for market recovery or additional deposits. After the grace period, if your balance remains below the minimum, your account will be reviewed by our client success team who will work with you on a transition plan. Benefits such as dedicated account managers and fixed spreads will be maintained during this review period. We do not downgrade accounts without personal consultation first.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are there any restrictions on the 0.00% trading fees for Super MVP accounts?",
    a: "Super MVP account holders enjoy zero trading fees (0.00% maker and taker) on all standard spot, margin, and futures trading pairs available on the platform. This applies to an unlimited volume of trades. The only exceptions are network/blockchain withdrawal fees for external transfers (these are third-party costs passed through at cost), and fees for certain specialized OTC or structured products which may have custom pricing agreed upon in your client agreement.",
  },
  {
    q: "What premium residency assistance is available for Super MVP clients?",
    a: "For Super MVP clients, 1 Trade Market can introduce you to our network of immigration lawyers and wealth management consultants who specialize in investor residency programmes. This includes various residency pathways available to high-net-worth individuals. Our team facilitates introductions, provides referrals, and assists with documentation, though the legal process is handled by licensed attorneys. This is an introduction and support service, not a guarantee of residency approval.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I upgrade multiple tiers at once if I make a large deposit?",
    a: "Yes, absolutely. If your deposit qualifies you for a higher tier, for example, depositing $1,000,000 which qualifies you for Diamond Elite, you will be placed directly at that tier, skipping intermediate tiers. All benefits of your final qualifying tier will be immediately activated. You do not need to \"earn\" through lower tiers. Contact your account manager when making a large deposit and they will expedite your tier review and onboarding.",
