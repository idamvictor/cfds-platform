    question: "What is the 10% early exit fee and when does it apply?",
    answer:
      'The 10% early exit fee applies to the gross amount for any exit within the 6-month hold period. Withdrawing $50,000 early means $5,000 is deducted — you receive $45,000 before taxes.',
    highlight: "After 6 months, withdrawals are completely fee-free.",
    highlightIcon: "lightbulb",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I withdraw a portion of my staked portfolio?",
    answer:
      "Partial withdrawals are allowed. The 10% fee applies only to the withdrawn portion. Your remaining balance stays invested and actively managed. Minimum partial withdrawal is $1,000.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to my open positions on early withdrawal?",
    answer:
      "All active portfolio positions are immediately force-closed at current market prices. Unrealised gains are added; unrealised losses are crystallised and deducted from your payout.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there tax implications on early withdrawal?",
    answer:
      "Early exits may trigger CGT in your home country. Retirement Staking™ is structured in a crypto-friendly jurisdiction to minimise exposure, but local laws vary. Consult a tax professional.",
    highlight:
      "Long-term holders (5+ years) benefit from the most favourable tax-efficient exit structure.",
    highlightIcon: "shield",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does an early withdrawal take?",
    answer:
      "24–48 hours after approval, including force-close of positions. After the 6-month hold period, standard withdrawals process within 1–3 business days.",
